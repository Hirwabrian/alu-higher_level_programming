>>>matrix = [[3, 6, 9],[12, 15, 18]]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

quotients are rounded to a maximum of two decimal places..
::
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

The original matrix is left unchanged.
